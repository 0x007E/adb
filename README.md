# `ADB` - Analog Development Board

The `ADB` is a board with an [LM358](#additional-information) or any other 2-channel operational amplifier. The board itself can be driven with a voltage of `5+/-15V`. The board offers the possibility to create standard `OPA` circuits with `THT` resistors/capacitors and inductors or any other external circuit.

# Hardware

The pcb is created with `KiCAD`. All files are built with `github actions` so that they are ready for a production environment.

## PCB

The circuit board is populated on both sides (Top, Bottom). The best way for soldering the `SMD` components is within a vapor phase soldering system and for the `THT` components with a standard soldering system. After placing and soldering the top parts, the board has to be cut off in the middle (white edge).
